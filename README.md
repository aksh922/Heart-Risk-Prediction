# Heart Disease Prediction App

An interactive machine learning web app built with **Streamlit** and **XGBoost** that predicts the risk of heart disease based on patient health data.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete ML workflow:
- Preprocessing real-world health data
- Training an accurate XGBoost classifier (~88% accuracy)
- Building a responsive Streamlit dashboard for predictions

The app allows:
- Single patient prediction through manual input
